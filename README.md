You can run your HTML file with any web browser. 

Make sure to refresh the page in your browser to see any changes.

## HTML, CSS & JavaScript

The HTML, CSS and JavaScript files within this project can be used to practice editing code with Visual Studio Code.

When you open this project in Visual Studio Code, you can practice editing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.

W3Schools has useful reference information for HTML, CSS & JavaScript: [www.w3schools.com](www.w3schools.com)
